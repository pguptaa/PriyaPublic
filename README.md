Welcome to my public github repo! 
This repo contains a collection of projects I worked on both in graduate school and in my free time using an array of machine learning, data engineering, statistical modeling.
Some of the projects you will find here are:

• Smartdispatch: Utilizes predictive analytic models (LSTM,KMeans) to equip emergency dispatchers and deliver the most
efficient and effective care possible for people in need
• Where(ii): Connected raw income, housing, and traffic data (all publicly available) into an interactive dashboard to help
consumers identify locations which maximize their income
• First 100 Days: A visualization created in Javascript D3 on the productivity of a Presidents first 100 days in office
• All the Feels: Developed a sentiment analysis model to predict emotions of short text using tensorflow and LSTM
